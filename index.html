<!-- To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Create a link within the paragraph <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a>
<a> </a> is for anchor tag, target = is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link and the value "_blank"specifies to open the link in a new tab, href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link, The text, "link to freecodecamp.org", within the anchor element called anchor text, will display a link to click
This create the dead link means not open the link, after a href=”#”
<a href="#""http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>
